# Web Deeplink App

This Next.js app supports deep links for payment links.

## Deep Link Support

- Dynamic route: `/[paymentLinkId]`
- Example: `/12345` will render the payment link page for ID `12345`.
- To test, open `/12345` in your browser or use the link on the homepage.

## How it works

- The file `src/app/[paymentLinkId]/page.tsx` handles dynamic payment link routes.
- Replace the `fetchPaymentLink` function in that file with your backend or Supabase logic to fetch real payment link data.

## Development

- Start the app with your preferred package manager (e.g., `bun dev`).
- Edit the dynamic route page to connect to your backend as needed.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
